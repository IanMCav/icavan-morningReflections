        <p>Cleansing rain despite being indoors, a auspicious start to a day.</p>
        <p>Hair first, every other day- you read online once that you should wash your hair every other day, something about natural oils and hair health. You aren't sure about that, but you do know that on the days you only wet your hair instead of washing it it stays down longer, behaves better, and is generally more tolerable- with hair as long as yours has gotten (forgetfulness, busy, delay delay delay, at this point it's easier to just wait until winter break) you'll take every day it isn't just poofing up around your head in a halo of fuzz as a blessing.</p>
        <p>Haven't you spent <a href="../comforting-warm-nice">enough</a> time in the water?</p>
