        <p>A sprint, heaving breaths. Dash, fitness. Birds chirping, the sun is shining. It's a beautiful day- 80 degrees, few clouds.</p>
        <p>You wish it was colder. It's too bright, the sun gets in your eyes, the sounds of nature distract you from any solutions.</p>
        <p>That's <a href="../panting-out-of-breath-never-again">enough</a> running.</p>
