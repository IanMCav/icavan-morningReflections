        <p>Delicate is the art of a morning routine. It belies an organization you've never achieved. Brush, jog, shower, breakfast, email (with coffee). You suppose that's the realm of being a functioning adult. </p>
        <p>Despite-or perhaps because of- your newfound adulthood, your mornings tend to involve email-shower-coffee, oh-shit-homework. When you were working (that wonderful time) last spring and summer, it was more like shower-work-breakfast. You wonder sometimes, if being an adult is just taking every day as it comes and knowing what you'll be doing next week too. If adulthood is just a series of habits and routines, then in your ability to just busy-busy-busy away a semester you're secretly an adult already. You always were a creature of habit.</p>
        <p>The idea that it's that easy scares you.</p>
        <p>If you wish to be one <a href="../or-already-are">enough</a>, will you become one?</p>
