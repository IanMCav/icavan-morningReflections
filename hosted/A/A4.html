        <p>Most important meal of the day- or so they say- you skip it, more often than you should. You sleep too much, too damned lazy to cook, here you just hate your kitchen, dirty as it is- your apartment is insufferable, suffocating. You've never established who did which chores, and still lack proper cleaning implements- 'One of these days' is the mantra that carries you, delaying necessity with lack of desire to act, delaying, delaying, delaying.</p>
