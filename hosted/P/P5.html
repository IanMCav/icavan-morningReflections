        <p>Self above all else. A short term gratification over long-term necessities. Some mornings in two (one-and-a-half) words.</p>
        <p>You live all about the short-term and the long-term, the 'today' and 'next year'. 'Next week' or 'next month' are nebulous concepts, which revolve around what's due. As long as there's nothing due 'tomorrow', and honestly sometimes not even then, you'll ignore what you should be doing for what you want to be doing, which always amounts to wasting time on the internet.</p>
