        <p>Some people are creatures of habit, needing order in their life, throughout all walks- order is valued. You have habits that you follow, little rituals you always abide, of questionable quality and utility but sufficient for your tastes, and as long as they go undisrupted your days are flexible.</p>
        <p>You live day-to-day in an endless stream of little routines trapped between 'oh-shit-what-next' and 'wait-that-was-due-tomorrow'. On occasion you're driven to break those routines, possibly out of sheer rebellion, but those days decrease in frequency as time goes on.</p>
        <p>You might not keep to an ordered schedule <a href="../ever">enough</a>.</p>
