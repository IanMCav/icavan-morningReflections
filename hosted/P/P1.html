        <p>A clean body is a clean mind and if cleanliness begets clarity, then certainly you'd clean, but there are balances to be pursued- you am simultaneously disgusted by the lack of cleanliness and too apathetic to do so- a lack of action that spreads and festers across all sides of life.</p>
        <p>Haircut? You don't want to drive, it's too late in the semester you're getting one when you get home anyway. Bring car in to get fixed? Eh, it'll be fine. Homework to do? You'll manage somehow.</p>
        <p>You can, you just don't- isn't that <a href="../too_late">enough</a>?</p>
