        <p>Education is the price you pay for fiscal freedom.</p>
        <p>You've always liked your university- it's far more upfront about the whole 'you're in college to get a job' concept than most. Higher education never really mattered to you, just making money from doing something that you didn't despise. It's not like you grew up poor or anything, but having money is better than not having money and considering how your life's been, you're more than willing to set aside dreams for practicality nowadays.</p>
        <p>You spent your last year of high school wanting to just go to college already, and you're spending your last year of college just wanting to be working already. What'll you be impatiently waiting for in four years? Eight? This morning you overslept, yesterday you decided to not finish a couple parts of the homework. This weekend you're going to pretend that you'll actually get work done on Sunday only to end up playing shitty games you don't even like but play out of inertia online for most of the day and get a superficial amount of homework done.</p>
        <p>You miss work partially because when you did nothing in your off hours at least you didn't feel anxious about not getting homework done.</p>
