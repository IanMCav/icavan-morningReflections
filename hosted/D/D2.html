        <p>Work is what you do to keep fiscal freedom.</p>
        <p>You had dreams, once. Oh, how you dreamed as a child. That, of course, was before you understood what pursuing your dreams meant, what you often ended up having to give up. Before you learned that you weren't quite as brave as you thought. Nowadays, pragmatism, inertia and a want for money (greed, your self-recrimination reminds you) push you away from your dreams and towards practicality. Being a cog in a corporate machine, well-compensated for you 40 hours a week feels satisfying in a way. Meaningful in your contribution to the Project, though not nearly as Great as you once wished to be, perhaps it is enough. There won't be children who want to be like you when they grow up, but you'll live out your life to its fullest and enjoy what time you have.</p>
        <p>That seems some combination of 'enough' and 'insufficient' to you, but 'enough' is all that you've ever really cared about.</p>
