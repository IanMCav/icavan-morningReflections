        <p style="color:white;">While oversleeping can be a concern, so too is <a style="color:white!important" href="H/H1.html">undersleeping</a>.</p>
        <p>When you wake up, there's a brief period of keeping your eyes closed, just embracing the comfort of your bed- a comfort that'll never be achieved when you're trying to fall asleep, and seems only to exist in the need to sleep.</p>

        <p>These decisions spread out, upon waking. Do you <a href="A/A1.html">sleep in</a>, do you <a href="A/A2.html">brush your teeth</a>? Perhaps you'll <a href="A/A3.html">make coffee</a> or <a href="A/A4.html">eat breakfast</a>? <a href="A/A5.html">Read email</a> or even go for <a href="A/A6.html">a jog</a>. Perhaps you'll <a href="A/A7.html">take a shower</a> or even <a href="A/A8.html">all those things</a>.</p>
        
        <p>I believe that the first thing we do in the mornings defines our priorities in life- <a href="P/P1.html">cleanliness</a>, <a href="P/P2.html">knowledge</a>, <a href="P/P3.html">physical fitness</a>, <a href="P/P4.html">order</a>, <a href="P/P5.html">self-gratification</a>. However this, too is debatable- instead, might we be defined by what we do after our awaking ritual is complete. Are you a <a href="D/D1.html">student</a>, who slaves away in endless education? Are you an <a href="D/D2.html">employee</a>, who slaves away in the endless monotony of your job? Or perhaps you're <a href="D/D3.html">free</a> from work, from school, from societal expectation and money, deemed the least valuable to society but perhaps the most free?</p>
        
        <p style="color:white!important;">Can't you just go <a style="color:white;" href="H/H2.html">back</a> to sleep?</p>
